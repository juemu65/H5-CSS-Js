    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1><br>
    <br>
    Dear Eileen,<br>
    <br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your<br>
    PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
    Starting dates<br>
    <br>
    We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could<br>
    start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:<br>
    <br>
    First semester: 9 September 2016<br>
    Second semester: 15 January 2017<br>
    Third semester: 2 May 2017<br>
    <br>
    Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br>
    <br>
    You can find more information about important university dates on our website.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Subjects of study<br>
    <br>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall
    somewhere<br>
    in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of
    person<br>
    we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in<br>
    order of priority:<br>
    <br>
    Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.)<br>
    Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30oC (86oF), when the audience
    size<br>
    exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104.)<br>
    HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.<br>
    <br>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research
    to<br>
    take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.<br>
    <br>

    Exotic dance moves<br>
    <br>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my<br>
    favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:<br>
    <br>
    Polynesian chicken dance<br>
    A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a
    circle<br>
    like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".<br>
    Icelandic brownian shuffle<br>
    Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved<br>
    huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very
    rapid<br>
    movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.<br>
    Arctic robot dance<br>
    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new<br>
    dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.<br>
    Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.<br>
    <br>
    For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.<br>
    <br>
    Yours sincerely,<br>
    Dr Eleanor Gaye<br>
